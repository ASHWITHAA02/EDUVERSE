## ⚠️ Important Note About Old Data

**If you see old error messages:**
- These are stored in the database from previous attempts
- **Solution:** Generate NEW summaries/analyses
- Old data will keep old errors until you regenerate it

**Example:**
- Old summary: "Error: 404 model not found" ❌
- New summary: "This lesson introduces Python..." ✅
